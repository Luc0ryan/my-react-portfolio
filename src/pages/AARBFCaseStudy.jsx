          The Alisa Ann Ruch Burn Foundation (AARBF) supports burn survivors and promotes
          fire prevention education across California. Their existing website was hard to navigateâ€”key information was buried, the donation flow was confusing,
          and the design no longer reflected the organization's reach or warmth. I redesigned
          the site from the ground up to create a clearer, more accessible experience that
          brings their story and impact forward.
